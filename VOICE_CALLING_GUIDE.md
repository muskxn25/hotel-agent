# Voice Calling Feature - AI to Human Transfer

## Overview
The hotel booking system now includes **AI-powered voice calling** with automatic transfer to human agents when needed.

## How It Works

### 1. Click "Call Support" Button
- Green button in the top-right header
- Initiates an AI voice call using VAPI  
- Works directly in your browser (no phone needed!)

### 2. AI Assistant Handles Initial Inquiry
The AI assistant (Sarah) can help with:
- ✅ Checking room availability
- ✅ Simple room bookings
- ✅ Answering questions about amenities
- ✅ Providing hotel policies
- ✅ Local information and directions

### 3. Automatic Transfer to Human Agent
The AI will transfer you to a human agent if:
- 🙋 You explicitly ask: "Can I speak to a person?"
- 😤 You seem frustrated or confused
- 💳 You have payment/billing issues
- 📋 You need complex assistance (group bookings, events)
- 🔄 You ask the AI to repeat multiple times
- ⚠️ The AI can't understand or help with your request

### 4. Human Agent Takeover
When transferred:
- Status changes to "Connected to Human Agent"
- Button turns orange: "👤 Human Agent"
- Visual indicator in chat shows transfer
- Human agent sees conversation history
- Seamless handoff with context

## Visual Indicators

## Technical Setup

### VAPI Configuration (Required)
```bash
# Add to .env file
VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key
```

### Test VAPI Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/vapi/public-key
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "configured": true,
  "public_key": "c7f725ac-..."
}
```

## How Transfer Works

### AI Detection
The AI uses GPT-4 to understand when transfer is needed:
```javascript
if (user asks for human || complex request || frustrated) {
    call transfer_to_agent function
}
```

### Transfer Function
```python
def transfer_to_agent(reason):
    return {
        'success': True,
        'transfer': True,
        'reason': reason,
        'message': 'Transferring to human agent...'
    }
```

### Frontend Handling
```javascript
if (functionName === 'transfer_to_agent') {
    showTransferAnimation();
    updateButtonToHuman();
    connectToHumanAgent();  // In production: real phone transfer
}
```
