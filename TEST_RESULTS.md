## 📞 **To Enable Phone Calls**

The phone call system needs one more step:

### **Option 1: Manual VAPI Setup**
1. Go to https://dashboard.vapi.ai
2. Create an assistant manually
3. Copy the assistant ID
4. Add to `.env`: `VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id`
5. Phone calls will work!

### **Option 2: Fix API Format** (For developers)
The assistant creation payload needs adjustment to match VAPI's current API spec. The authentication works, just need to match their expected JSON structure.
